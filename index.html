                Hyderabad is city of historic importance. I have visited famouse Gowalkonda Fort and witnessed excellent Light and Sound Show which was organised by Fort authorities. My favourate in Hyderabad is Hussain Sagar Lake and well managed and maintained Laser show which is example of excellent mark of science and technology. Hyderabadi food specially Biryani both in Veg. and Non Vegetirian are excellent,delitious very nice in taste. Your tour of hyderabad is incomple if you miss biryani of Hyderabad. Hyderabad have excellent religious value which is we witnessed by visiting Srisailum. Nagarjuna Sagar Dam and Srisailum Dam are excellent and nice spot to visit where you will get natural beauty in abundant.
